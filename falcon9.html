              <h3>What is Falcon 9?</h3>
              <p>
                The infamous Falcon 9 rocket of SpaceX is the companies second,
                completely self manufactured orbital class launch vehicle.<br />
                It is the successor of the Falcon 1, which had only a few test
                and cargo flights until it was replaced by the Falcon 9.<br />
                The rocket receives its name from the Star Wars Millennium
                Falcon and its nine Merlin-1D engines, which are obviously also
                developed by SpaceX.<br />
                Its characteristic speciality is that the first / booster stage
                autonomously returns back to earth and lands itself with a so
                called suicide burn. Because of that the booster can be
                refurbished and therefore reused several times. This makes the
                rocket very cost efficient and simultaneously more sustainable
                than rockets of SpaceX' competitors.
